# üçÑ Mushroom Classification - Edible or Poisonous?

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** based on their physical characteristics. It is based on the [UCI Mushroom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification) and was completed as part of an internship project in the Agriculture domain.

## üìå Problem Statement

The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms states that there is no simple rule for determining mushroom edibility. This project builds a machine learning model that predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using its 22 categorical attributes (like odor, gill color, habitat, etc.).
